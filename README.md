# DVWA
I have successfully completed testing the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) on low, medium, and high security levels. The testing process involved identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and analyzing security measures at each level. A detailed report of the findings, methodologies, and outcomes has been compiled into a PDF.
